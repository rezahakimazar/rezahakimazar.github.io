Dear Dr. Paul,

I am writing to express my genuine enthusiasm for the student assistant position.
My name is Reza Hakimazar, a second-year masterâ€™s level student in research psychology at the University of Hamburg.

I've been working as a student assistant since last year at the University of Hamburg in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Learning and Change.
Mostly, I've been committed to two projects, specifically Digital and Data Literacy in Teaching Lab and Implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and Reproducible Teaching.
Both of these projects were supervised by Dr. Lennart Wittkuhn.

These projects involved conducting literature reviews in the field of open science and reproducible research to write an online guide on tools needed for a more reproducible scientific society, in particular in psychology.
After Dr. Wittkuhn unfortunately left the group, I was assigned to the ongoing projects in the group.

Given my previous experience with EEG data collection, pre-processing, and analysis, I was assigned to help two master's students with running their experiments for their thesis under direct supervision of Dr. Alexa Ruel.
The aforementioned previous experience with EEG comes from a project seminar I took last year with Dr. Alexa Ruel.
In this highly valuable seminar, we learned both theoretical rationale behind EEG and also had hands-on experience by collecting data in that seminar and then analysing and writing a preliminary research article which I have included with my application documents.

What also excites me is that this project will focus on linking neurological foundations of personality characteristics.
As someone who is also interested in personality and social psychology, the topic would enrich my knowledge in different ways.

As mentioned before, I have the experience which aligns with your project.
My performance, abilities to coordinate projects, reliability and conscientious work ethic in the previous projects I've been involved in can be confirmed by colleagues I've worked with.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Reza Hakimazar
