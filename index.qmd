# About

I am a master's student in **research psychology** at the **University of Hamburg**, currently working on my master's thesis about mate-accuracy of face perception.

My academic interests include **social psychology** [^1], and **science communication** [^2]. Recently, I have also been focusing on improving my skills in **quantitative research methods in psychology** & learning about **causal inference**, **modelling and its application in social psychology**.

[^1]: More accurately, person percetion and social cognition.

[^2]: Pop science, psychology for the public and also FAIR principles in research
