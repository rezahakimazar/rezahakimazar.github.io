I believe this can be the first step of transforming ideas into actions— probably the hardest thing for humans.\nThe word challenge translates to die Herausforderung, which, as far as I understand, illustrates the idea of something that calls you out and demands a response.

Second, a low number of psychologists doesn’t always mean an increase in hate victimization. Third, countries that have an increasing trend have more psychologists than other countries in most cases. It reflects the importance of creating groups of experts from different fields to solve this multidimensional problem and not relying only on psychologists. The bad news is that we couldn’t find decreasing trends in the countries we collected data from. This can also be an indicator of better data communication and hate vicimization cases being recognized."
