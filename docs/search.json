Second, a low number of psychologists doesn’t always mean an increase in hate victimization. Third, countries that have an increasing trend have more psychologists than other countries in most cases. It reflects the importance of creating groups of experts from different fields to solve this multidimensional problem and not relying only on psychologists. The bad news is that we couldn’t find decreasing trends in the countries we collected data from.

    "text": "Universität Hamburg Geschäftsstelle Deutschlandstipendium Rothenbaumchaussee 19 Hamburg 20148 Reza Hakimazar c/o Rajaei Bürgerweide 53 Hamburg 20535 Subject: Letter of Motivation for Deutschlandstipendium Dear Selection Committee, I am writing to express my genuine enthusiasm for the Deutschlandstipendium. My name is Reza Hakimazar, a second-year master’s level student in research psychology at the University of Hamburg. As a top-level student, I consider myself an ideal candidate for this prestigious stipend. I truly believe that my personal achievements, academic accomplishments, and social commitments reflect the ideals of this scholarship. I have a GPA of 1.3 in my current studies, which is in a highly challenging field, even for gaining admission given its NC-restriction, let alone achieving outstanding grades. This strong academic record is not limited to my ongoing studies only, since I completed my bachelor’s degree with a 1.4 total GPA, which placed me among the top 15% of students at graduation, showcasing the longevity and consistency of my efforts. Professionally, I am committed to two projects at the University of Hamburg, namely Digital and Data Literacy in Teaching Lab and Implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and Reproducible Teaching. In these projects, I focus on crafting a concrete framework to make teaching materials sustainable, first at the University of Hamburg, with the goal of implementing these principles at more universities and research institutes around the world. I contribute to this project by increasing the longevity of the teaching materials, such as lecture slides, research outputs, and guides This can decrease the workload of academics by a sizable amount. They will not need to redo everything to prepare materials for each semester, leading to a more sustainable approach to teaching. In the research area, academia can benefit from the sustainability features of the project by making research computationally reproducible. As a psychology student, I am eager to contribute to resolving the so-called replication crisis in psychology, which is a long-recognized problem in psychological research that results in the failure to replicate 39% of high-impact psychology studies. Beyond academics, I have been and continue to be involved in several community-focused initiatives that help marginalized groups, such as refugees, especially Afghan asylum seekers. This aligns with my research skills gained during writing my bachelor’s thesis on investigating discrimination and its effects among women in Iran. As a part of the international Hate Victimization: Culturally Competent Care for Minorities and Marginalized Groups project organized by the European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations (EFPSA), I am working on enhancing the quality of life of the refugees in Germany and Iran. I am investigating the occurrence of hate speech, social exclusion, and perceived discrimination among Afghan refugees in Iran and Germany. Through this project, I hope to have an impact on policy makers in both countries to improve the situation of the refugees in the two countries. The results of this research program will be presented at the EFPSA Congress 2025 in Turkey. My dedication to binding psychology and society goes further by establishing a remotely managed non-profit organization called Ravanyaraa Psychology Group in Iran. At Ravanyaraa, we hold workshops, consultyoung students, and publish a psychology magazine for laypeople. I believe that science communication is significant to build trust between public and scientific institutes. I am the editor-in-chief and layout designer of the magazine and also the manager of this organization. I had the idea of creating my own psychology group during my bachelor’s when I was a board member of the Psychology Student Association at the University of Isfahan. This association fosters academic discussion and community learning at the university. I was engaged in these activities throughout all four years of my bachelor’s. Volunteering and public engagement have also been important aspects of my journey. I was part of an Accessibility Improvement Project in Isfahan, the third largest city in Iran, conducting field research and collaborating with public authorities to enhance street accessibility for people with disabilities. Also, I was selected to volunteer in a group to provide psychological first aid for Afghan families in the city of Isfahan, Iran by The United Nation Refugee Agency. Coming from a Middle Eastern developing country, financial hurdles have always been significant obstacles for me. In Iran, there is an undeclared, unoffcial ongoing conflict that has severely impacted my family’s financial status, my primary source of support. Due to this adverse situation, I have encountered visa extension problems, as one of the main documents required for extending a residence permit is proof of a plausible source of income. Therefore, the Deutschlandstipendium would play a critical role in solving this problem and would relieve a lot of tension. Furthermore, this scholarship would help me focus mainly on my study, social, and academic projects. Without the worry of paying bills, I can concentrate on using my psychological knowledge to solve real-world problems in my ongoing projects. I feel deeply connected to the values of the Deutschlandstipendium, and I believe that receiving this award will undoubtedly push me a step closer to making the world a better, more sustainable place. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Reza Hakimazar 2"
