This is the official start of my new challenge:

-   I have recently started to work out, gonna keep it going.

-   I'm gonna begin with lowering my daily social media consumption.

-   Replace social media with TV series, movies, and books.

-   And most importantly, I'm gonna read a research paper every day or every two days.

I'm just documenting these here to throw them out of my mind. I believe this can be the first step of transforming ideas into actionsâ€” probably the hardest thing for humans.

The word challenge translates to *die Herausforderung*, which, as far as I understand, illustrates the idea of something that calls you out and demands a response. I find it interesting and thoughtful.
